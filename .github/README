TOML.NVIM
================

A proof of concept plugin. Configure Neovim with TOML/JSON.


HOW CAN I HELP?
===============

This is a WIP plugin which means that there are no features yet.
But, if you have some ideas on what to add then make an issue:
* I need help writing docs.
* I need help designing the API.
* Any more feature ideas?
